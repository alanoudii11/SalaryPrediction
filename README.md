# SalaryPrediction


# Project Motivation:
The goal of our dataset is to predict whether or not the yearly salary exceeds $50,000. Salary is a great source of motivation for employees, and as a result, we believe that salary prediction can be helpful to both employees and their employers, as it can roughly calculate the expected salaries, and the relationship between salaries and various factors. This information can be helpful to both employees and employers in negotiating for a fair salary and making better hiringÂ decisions.

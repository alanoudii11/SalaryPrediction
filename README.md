# SalaryPrediction


# Project Motivation:
The goal of our dataset is to predict whether or not the yearly salary exceeds $50,000. Salary is a great source of motivation for employees, and as a result, we believe that salary prediction can be helpful to both employees and their employers, as it can roughly calculate the expected salaries, and the relationship between salaries and various factors.

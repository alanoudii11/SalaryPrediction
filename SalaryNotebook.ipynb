    "# Goal of Collecting this Dataset\n",
    "Salary is a great source of motivation for employees, and as a result, we believe that salary prediction can be helpful to both employees and their employers, as it can roughly calculate the expected salaries, and the relationship between salaries and various factors. This information can be helpful to both employees and employers in negotiating for a fair salary and making better hiring decisions. <br> <br>\n",

    "# Data Mining Task\n",

    "Our overall aim is to create a reliable salary prediction model using both classification and clustering techniques. This model can assist employees and employers in making more informed decisions about compensation and hiring.\n",

    "__Classification:__ We will classify employees into different groups based on their personal and professional characteristics. This will allow us to predict the salary of new employees based on certain factors .<br>\n",
    "__Clustering:__ We will create a set of clusters for employees who have similar characteristics. This will allow us to identify groups of employees who are likely to have similar salaries.<br> <br>\n",

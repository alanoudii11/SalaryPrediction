    "# Goal of Collecting this Dataset\n",
    "Our project aims to predict weather an employee makes over 50k a year, so we will apply two data mining tasks which is classification and clustering. For classification we will classify the employees into different groups using their individual characteristics, such as age, gender, race, education, etc.  For the clustering task we will create a set of clusters for the employees who have comparable qualifications, so we can use these clusters to predict new employees’ yearly salary.\n"
